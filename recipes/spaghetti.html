<h3>Description</h3>
<p> Spaghetti and meatballs is a classic and comforting Italian dish. It involves tender meatballs made from a flavorful blend of ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices. The meatballs are then simmered in a rich tomato sauce and served over a bed of perfectly cooked spaghetti. This timeless combination of savory meatballs, tangy tomato sauce, and al dente pasta creates a satisfying and mouthwatering meal that is loved by both young and old alike.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ground meat (such as beef, pork, or a combination)</li>
    <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Egg</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce</li>
    <li>Tomato paste</li>
    <li>Dried herbs (such as oregano and basil)</li>
    <li>Spaghetti noodles</li>
    <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (for garnish)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, breadcrumbs, finely chopped onion and garlic, beaten egg, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
<li>Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 to 2 inches in diameter, and set them aside.</li>
<li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook them until browned on all sides, ensuring they are cooked through. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
<li>In the same skillet, add crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried herbs, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir well to combine and let the sauce simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
<li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it and add it to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss the spaghetti gently to coat it with the sauce.</li>
<li>Serve the spaghetti topped with the cooked meatballs. You can garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.</li>
